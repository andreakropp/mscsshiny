"Overall a great place. Outside could use some work though. We diffently go back.
excellent lunch dishes.  portions are huge.  try the chicken chow mein-the best.
Great, fast service, and good food makes this the go to chinese when in the area
Food is always great here. Not a bad spot for a lunch special quick stop either.
The pho and spring rolls are bomb! Very flavorful, well priced, and fast service
Pretty good dim sum. Good service. Good food. Gets really packed on the weekend.
Love the food here.  Very generous portion and great taste.  Highly recommended.
Lovely owner...\nGreat staff, cheap prices and healthy choices!\nLove love love!
Fast service and great takeout! The orange beef and walnut shrimp are fantastic.
Always good food, affordable and clean. Their new coke machines are min blowing.
This such a unique place and so is the food. Oh and by the way it is fantastic!!
Highly recommend the Gluten Free shakin beef dish. Cook and delivered perfectly!
food is not bad, but for all the reputation of Puck, it's way below expectation.
My neighborhood Chinese restaurant. Food is delicious and the portions are huge.
This place has an AMAZING happy hour....tons of apps and drinks for super cheap.
Service was okay. Nothing special. Tasted like standard take-out. Not impressed.
Best place on earth to eat. Period. Get the ceviche and whatever the special is.
There is no bar , had a party of 5, 2nd visit try the scallop dish it was killer
The restaurant smells off when you walk in and my chicken teriyaki felt squishy.
Good lunch if you need something cheap and easy to swallow. Dont order the soup.
Good food, good service, been there twice, highly recommended for budget diners.
This place is FABULOUS.  Cheap prices especially for lunch and always good food.
After the change of ownership, this place is horrible now.  It's just too salty!
Love this local authentic Cantonese seafood restaurant. Great food great service
The Salt and Pepper flounder is amazing.  The egg drop soup is amazing as well.
Yummy Chinese food.  I love the eggplant dish.  Good for dining in or take-out.
Just did carry out. Panda Express is WAY better. Actually, Taco Bell is better.
Eggplant garlic sauce is awesome but it would be nice to have less oil in it :)
Had them deliver and it was still hot!  Always great service and really yummy!!
This place is my go to for pho. They're fast, consistent, cheap, and delicious.
Omg so good and huge servings!  The chefs specialty shrimp dish us my favorite.
Love it! my fav is the Thai beef salad.......yum. Anything you order is delish.
Chin Chin can also mean \"penis\" in Japanese.  Great marketing staff over there
Great lunch prices. Service is always fast and friendly. And the food is tasty.
Great pad thai food. Pricing is very good and most lunch specials are 5.00-6.00
really not satisfied... realy didn't want to remember what happened in here....
Good combos. Still getting used to the Chinese/Mexican combination. Good stuff.
Fish quality is okay. Rolls are oversauced... Average Americanized sushi/ rolls
Lots of different styles that I'm used to but always great to try new things...
Over priced for what it is. A good place to have a couple drinks for happy hour
Amazing service, food, happy hour, cocktails and atmosphere.  Can't get enough!
Very good, Lunch special 7 Days a week. Decent amount of food for decent price.
Food editable but not much else.  Will not be back.  Weird smell it place too..
I come in here every week for some delicious comfort food--a large bowl of Pho!
Service was great and so was the food. We enjoyed a wonderful dinner as always!
Every trip to Vegas includes a meal at PF Changs. Great food and great service!
The side dishes are amazing. This is authentic Korea home cooking at it's best.
Slightly pricey for a buffet, but for a good number of choices, it works out..!
For the price, you can't beat this place. Great food in a no-frills atmosphere.
Seems a bit pricey for the amount of food. Good flavor tho, and friendly staff.
Sooooooo Dang good. Very fresh and fast, I will be back next time I am in Vegas
Way too over priced for little portions, tasty stuff but honestly not worth it.
3.5 stars for hainan chicken w rice.  1 star for the curry beef brisket w rice.
Very nice find. Selection, quality, service well worth the price. Am a regular!
be nice if their food was actually made by the Asians and not store bought.....
The absolute best tart cabbage/noodle soup and dumplings EVER!  It was awesome.
Took way too long for delivery.  Food was decent.  Crab Ragoons were delicious.
What a great vegetarian/vegan restaurant!  I'll be back next time I'm in Vegas.
Absolutely great! Loved the garlic chicken, a great staff and was very clean...
I love their NOODLES! Try the Shanghai Noodles with vegetables (order it dry).
awful, food was not good, people with me got sick and will not go there again.
No flavor in their food. The service was great but the food was disappointing.
Panda Express sounds good. I only gave them 2 stars because it was dirt cheap.
Good lettuce wraps, lots of selection, attentive service. Overall a good place
good for lunch, delivery  take out.  varied menu (thai, chines, and dumplings)
This restaurant is gone.  :(  It is now a place going to be called China Jade.
The staff was wonderful. The crab was amazing. This alone is reason to return.
The jade red chicken is amazing. The cookies are the perfect ending to a meal.
Tasty and fast, if you get there at 11am. I'm liking the combo lunch specials.
Good service, but fast food quality food. For the price you expect a LOT more.
Nothing spectacular. I actually think Panda Express is better than this place.
Baaaaaaaad Vietnamese food seriously how can they screw up banh cuon like this
Great buffet for a great price \nA lot of good food for you $$\nI recommend This
Kim is the best bartender ask for her she makes the best long island in Vegas!
Seated promptly, friendly staff, good chicken curry.  Overall, not bad at all.
Very good Chinese food. Handmade dumpling and noodles.  I like them very much!
It's Panda Express! Fast food Chinese-ish food. When you're hungry this works.
It's not bad, it's a good place to grab a quick meal. Service is also friendly
Your average Americanized Chinese buffet. \nThe salmon was good.\nAbove average.
Juicy dumplings are very good. Like in Monterey Park good home made dumplings.
Not good food in there.no more. makes me sick!
Delicious. The shrimp wonton soup and salt & pepper fried wings are must eats!
Hao Bao is back in business! Follow them on https://www.facebook.com/HaoBaoUSA
Solid Chinese food. Total Dive. Owner couldn't be nicer. Fantastic egg rolls.
They have the best PHO in Vegas!!!! I always get extra noodles and meatballs.
The best pho! Its phobulous! Super over priced. Great atmosphere. And yummmy!
4 star just to be humble and leave room for development, otherwise perfect 5.
amyone that lives in vegas knows this is the best cheap asian buffet in town.
They microwaved our dim sum in front of us. Depressing. Nothing more to stay.
Unimpressive... I'd rather go to Panda Express. I didn't even finish my food.
Not offensive, just not overly exciting either.  I may be back, or I may not.
My favorite place they know me by name and always have my order right on que!
I love their specialty rolls, they all melt in your mouth and are very fresh!
Rice wasn't cooked properly. Chicken was very good however.  Clean restaurant
Just love this place as do my kids. Servers are super friendly and fast :) :)
The food is fantastic and the fresh baked snicker doodles are mouth watering!
Great service, good Dim Sum. But what do I know? I'm a stupid American... LOL
Not really memorable but, good dependable Chinese food. I like the space too.
Great food/service. I tried 3 different things and it all tasted really good.
Celebrated a party with 16 people and the food and service both were amazing."
